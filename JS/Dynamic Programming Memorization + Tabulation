# Alvin's Memorization Recipe (Dynamic Memorization)
1. Make it work.
  Visualize the problem as a tree
  Implement the tree using recursion
  Test it
2. Make it efficient
  Add a memo object
  Add a base case to return memo values
  Store return values into the memo
  
# Tabulation Recipe (Dynamic Tabulation)
  Visualize the problem as a table
  Size the table based on the inputs
  Initialize the table with default values
  Seed the trivial answer into the table
  Iterate through the table
  Fill further positions based on the current position

# Dynamic Programming
  Notice any overlapping subproblems
  Decide what is the trivially smallest input
  Think recursively to use Memorization
  Think iteratively to use Tabulation
  Draw a strategy first!!!
